# NAIS Smart-Glasses HAR Project  
Course Materials for Native AI Solutions Development (Unit 2.1 – On-Device Optimization)

This repository contains all resources needed to complete **Unit 2.1** of the *Native AI Solutions Development* course.  
You will learn how to:

- load a baseline Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model,  
- explore and understand preprocessed IMU sensor data,  
- measure latency, accuracy, and model size,  
- apply optimization techniques such as **quantization** and **pruning**,  
- export a final **optimized on-device model** ready for integration.

The scenario is based on **smart safety glasses** used in indoor industrial operations.
